### Introduction
This is an example site based on pure bootstrap. 

### How to use
Just copy html files and folders either locally, or on to the root directory of your site.
Open index.html and enjoy

### What's next
For now you can edit contents directly editing html and mystyles.css, but in future repositories js framework will be introduced.
